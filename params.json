I'm hoping to use my knowledge in computer science and focus on computer graphics and animation. All my technical skills are in my resume below, but some of my hobbies are playing Starcraft, playing basketball, watching movies, Photoshop pictures, bowling, cooking, baking, drawing, and going on spontaneous adventures.\r\n\r\n### My resume\r\n<a href=\"Vincent_Escueta_resume.pdf\">Résumé</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
